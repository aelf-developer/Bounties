# DApp Competition | DAO Bounty Project

# Project name
Testnet DApp Development Competition Plan


# Project Description
According to the mainnet launch roadmap, aelf has officially released a new testnet V1.0.0 preview 1. This upgrade includes complete functionality and all features required to proceed with the Mainnet launch. Developers can use the framework template provided by aelf for smart contract deployment. aelf provides supporting users a guide handbook, smart contract and DApp development tutorial cases.

In order to encourage more developers to participate in the aelf ecosystem, aelf will host the TestNet Light DApp Development Competition. Developers can build a lightweight DApp based on the development template provided on the aelf blockchain system. There will be no restrictions on the DApp type or use case. We will also provide some reference cases for the developers.
 
# DApp competition design requirements
1. There are no restrictions on Dapp types. Participants can refer to popular DApp applications for design and development,  or develop unique DApps.

2. To maximise your chances

- a. ensure DAPP features can be used smoothly.

- b. DAPP UI should be simple and clear at least, and beautiful UI can be considered as a highlight.

3. DApp development specifications need to observe the aelf development specifications.

4. DAPP needs to be developed and deployed based on aelf public testnet V1.0.0 preview 1.

Note: Supports C # , Python, Javascript, Java, Golang, PHP language development.

5. All submissions need to pass the aelf Enterprise environment test under the application scenario and run stably.



# Reference Cases
The following cases DAPP do not currently exist on the aelf chain, this development competition is focused on lightweight DAPPs. We mention a few relatively lightweight dapp classes here as examples, just for reference. Feel free to develop more creative DAPP scenarios.

Reference 1: Chain Record

You can design dapps that store meaningful information in a chain. Such as tracking current epidemic data, public information records, travel records, eternal album memorials and other record-keeping applications.

Reference 2: Mini Game

You can also design interesting minigame dapps that are simple and easy to play, with a clear process and low barriers to entry. For example: Random Number Contest, Guessing Box, Random Guess/Match Card, Greedy Snake, Prizes Snatching, etc.



# Awards
Best Application Award (1 person) : 20,000 ELF

Winning Design Award (1 person) : 12,000 ELF
